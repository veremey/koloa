							<p class="desc__fb"  data-stagger>If you are here on Kaua’i or are planning to visit the island, we’d like to invite you to stop by our Tasting Room and Company Store, centrally located in Lihue at the Kilohana Plantation. Whether you have had too much sun, sand, surf, hiking or you just need a break, our rumtenders offer fun and informative tastings every half-hour beginning at 10 a.m., seven days a week. The unique flavors of rum change daily and may include a taste of one of our ready-to-drink cocktails and a sip of three of our unique award-winning rums. Please visit the Tasting Room page for hours and daily sipping menu. Don’t forget to stop by our Company Store while you are there. It’s a one stop shop for the best souvenirs on island featuring our authentic, single-batch Hawaiian premium white, gold, dark, spice, coconut and coffee Koloa Rum and mai tai, rum punch and pineapple passion rum ready-to-drink cocktails. You may purchase deliciously famous rum cake that you will sample at your tasting, rum fudge sauce, baked goods, and many different styles of custom logo wear for both men and women, not to mention the famous Kukui Brand jams and jellies, children’s Kukui Brand logo wear, the popular non-alcoholic mai tai mix and many other Kaua’i Made products.</p>
